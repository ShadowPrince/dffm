What? Hacky tool that makes active monitor follow mouse.


Why? New windows will always appear on the monitor you are looking on.


Usage? Compile (or download from releases) and run as user.


Bugs? Doesn't track display layout change (i.e. you need to restart it if display configuration changed).
